      Review the top 10 interview questions you'll most likely be asked at a job interview, plus examples of the best answers. Also, review the other questions you may be asked, so you're prepared to ace the interview.

    1. What is your greatest strength? - Best Answers
    This is one of the questions that employers almost always ask. When you are asked about your greatest strengths, it's important to discuss the attributes that will qualify you for the specific job and set you apart from the other candidates. Take the time, before the job interview, to make matches between your qualifications and the requirements as stated on the job announcement. This way, you will have examples ready to hand that will demonstrate your suitability for the job.

    2. What is your greatest weakness? - Best Answers
    Another typical question interviewers will ask is about your weaknesses.

    Do your best to frame your answers around positive aspects of your skills and abilities as an employee, turning seeming “weaknesses” into strengths. For example, you might say something like, “I’ve always struggled with perfectionism – I truly want to do the job correctly the first time, but this sometimes mean that I devote more time to a project than is necessary.

    I’ve learned, though, to balance this drive with the equally important responsibility of meeting deadlines.”

    You can also share examples of skills you have improved, providing specific instances of how you have recognized and worked to strengthen a weakness.

    3. Tell me about yourself. - Best Answers
    Here’s how to answer questions about yourself without giving out too much – or too little – personal information. Start by sharing some of your personal interests and experiences which don't relate directly to work, such as a favorite hobby or a brief account of where you grew up, your education, and what motivates you. Remember to be politic, however – avoid potentially contentious subjects such as political or religious leanings, unless you are absolutely positive that your opinions would be well-received by your interviewer. You should also avoid talking too much about family responsibilities or hobbies that might make your interviewer wonder whether you could commit yourself 100% to the job.

    4. Why should we hire you? - Best Answers
    Are you the best candidate for the job? Be prepared to say why you're the applicant who should be hired.  This is not the time to be modest (although neither should you be conceited).

  <q>
    Make your response a confident, concise, focused sales pitch that explains what you have to offer the employer, and why you should get the job.

   5. What are your salary expectations? - Best Answers
   What are you looking for in terms of salary? It seems like a simple question, but your answer can knock you out of the contest for the job if you overprice yourself. Here's the best way to answer questions about salary.

   6. Why are you leaving or have left your job? - Best Answers
   When asked about why you are moving on from your current position, stick with the facts, be direct, and focus your interview answer on the future, especially if your leaving wasn't under the best of circumstances. Always try to put a positive slant on your response; it’s better to give the impression that you’re more motivated by the possibility of new opportunities than by trying to escape a bad situation.

  <blockquote>
    7. Why do you want this job? - Best Answers
  This question gives you an opportunity to show the interviewer what you know about the job and the company, so take the time before the interview to thoroughly research the company, its products or services, its climate, and its mission. Be specific about what makes you a good fit for this role, and mention aspects of the company and position that appeal to you.

  8. How do you handle stress and pressure? - Best Answers
  What do you do when things don’t go smoothly at work? The best way to respond to this question is to give an example of how you have successfully handled stress in a previous job.

  9. Describe a difficult work situation / project and how you overcame it. - Best Answers
  The interviewer wants to know what you do when you face a difficult decision. As with the question about stress, be prepared to share an example of what you did in a tough situation.

  10. What are your goals for the future? - Best Answers
  This question is designed to find out if you’re going to stick around or move on as soon as you find a better opportunity. Keep your answer focused on the job and the company you’re interviewing with.
